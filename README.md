# Combustion-Numerical-Analysis-of-Turbulent-Flame
This project explores the complex interaction between turbulence and flame fronts in premixed combustion. Using LES or RANS models within a CFD framework, the simulation captures the wrinkling of the flame surface, heat release rate, and transport of reactive species.
